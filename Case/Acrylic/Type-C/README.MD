## Acrylic Case - Type-C

I made this because the original design had a few issues:
- ProMicro That use USB Type-C has longer pyhsical dimensions than the original ProMicro, making it not fit in the case.
- When using TRRS with L-Shaped connectors, the case would bend the cable and make it look ugly.
- The original design has too many sharp edges, making it harder for manufacturer to produce, I went to fillet all the edges to make it easier to produce and safer when handling.
