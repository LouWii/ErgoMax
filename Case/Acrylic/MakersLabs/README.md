## Acrylic Case - MakerLabs

![Ergomax acrylic case laser cut](../../../Guide/img/ergomax-assembled.jpg)

This is the version of the case that I got laser cut at a local shop called MakerLabs. It's the only one I have, and used for a while on my ErgoMax. It's using different thicknesses of acrylic sheets.

* Layer 1: 3mm (top)
* Layer 2: 4.5mm
* Layer 3: 3mm
* Layer 4: 6mm
* Layer 5: 3mm (bottom)

Each file works for any side, except the layer 5 that has a logo on it which is why there's a separate left and right.

The idea was to get the logo etched on the bottom layer, but it apaprently had issues and I was not able to get that done.
